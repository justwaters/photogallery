### Credits

The photo gallery is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
 
I didn't have a lot of time to build a website for a college project, so I used [this](https://github.com/haltakov/simple-photo-gallery) template from @haltakov, and customized it for my own personal use.

To learn how to build your own website on Github using repositories, I would recommend [this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) tutorial.
